# Aetherstory

A personal AI story generator that remembers. Characters keep their history, every story is saved, and a shared "world bible" (lore, places, relationships, timeline) grows automatically after each story, so recurring characters build real continuity.

Everything runs in your browser and is stored on your device. There is no server and no app account; the AI runs through a free OpenRouter key you paste in once.

## Open it

**Phone or PC (recommended):** open the GitHub Pages link for this repo, then use your browser's *Install app* / *Add to Home Screen*. It then launches like a normal app.

**PC without hosting:** download the repo and double-click `index.html`.

Data is per device and per browser. To move your library between PC and phone, use **Settings → Export backup** on one and **Import backup** on the other. Backups are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a random key unique to the device that made them (the API key is never included). To open a backup on a different device, also tap **Download key** on the original device and choose that `aetherstory-key.txt` when the new device asks for it. Keep the key file apart from your backups; without it, a backup can't be opened if the original browser's data is cleared.

## First run

1. **First launch:** confirm you are 18+, then follow the three on-screen steps to make a free OpenRouter key and paste it. That sets up the free Nemotron 3 Ultra model (about 25 stories a day; may soften some explicit scenes). Mature content is on by default. *Settings → Advanced mode* keeps the presets, base URL, model and temperature: Gemma 4 (free), Venice Uncensored (under 1 cent a story) and Euryale 70B (paid, reliably uncensored), or a local Ollama/LM Studio. You may need to allow free-model providers in OpenRouter's privacy settings.
2. **Write:** tap *Create my world* (optionally type a one-line vibe). The AI invents a world and a starting cast.
3. Pick characters, tap *Generate story*. Leave the premise blank and the AI chooses one that fits your world.

After each story the app asks the AI what changed and updates the world, the characters' "story developments", and adds any new recurring characters. The next story reads all of that.

**Revise** fixes a detail everywhere at once. Type the change in plain words ("Ana has red hair, not black"); the AI updates the character sheets, the world notes and every saved story that contradicts it, shows each change for review, and applies them on one tap. The last five revisions can be undone. Future stories follow the change because they read the updated sheets.

## AI providers

Any OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint works: OpenRouter, OpenAI, or a local model through Ollama (`http://localhost:11434/v1`) or LM Studio (`http://localhost:1234/v1`). For Ollama, start it with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` so the browser may call it.

## Development

No build step. `node --test` runs the logic tests in `test/`. Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` when shipping changes so installed copies update.
